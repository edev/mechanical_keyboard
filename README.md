# Mechanical Keyboard

Building a custom mechanical keyboard involves a great deal of research and planning. This repository maps out the problem space with a focus on the keyboard I may eventually build for myself. If you're reading this, welcome, and I hope it helps you on your journey! Constructive contributions of all kinds are welcome: please open an Issue or pull request, and thanks in advance!

# User story

* I'm constantly writing both software and English, both personally and professionally. These are my primary, motivating use cases; everything else is secondary.
* I own at least 3 off-the-shelf keyboards other folks can use when they come over, so I'm okay with customizing my keyboard to suit my exact use case.
* I love Linux and Vim, and I use them constantly. I use Windows daily, too. I never use Macs, and I don't plan to start.
* I play games sometimes, and when I do, I use macros a fair bit. I tend to play the same games for weeks or months rather than hopping between games, so I can tolerate a little bit of hassle in setting up a new profile, if the end result is worth the effort. On-the-fly customization (from Windows, while gaming) is a nice-to-have, not a must-have.
* I use my keyboard from my desk, from my couch, and sometimes from the kitchen. My ideal keyboard can go anywhere I go and talk to whatever computers are nearby.
* I most often work from home, but I occasionally co-work with a friend, and I may work in an office at least some of the time in the future. If my keyboard is noticeably audible to those around me, I won't be comfortable using it.
* I often use my keyboard and a microphone simultaneously, e.g. for gaming with friends or conferencing. I want to be able to use any microphone that's convenient without broadcasting keyboard noise.
* I often listen to quiet, instrumental music while I work. I don't want my keyboard to disturb it.
* I want my next keyboard to last me a long time, both in terms of meeting my needs and in terms of being fully serviceable and supported by firmware updates for a long time.
* I sometimes control 2-3 computers on my desk in a single session, e.g. desktop, laptop, and home server.
